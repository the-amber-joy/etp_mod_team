* Fix Add New Offender modal
* Login page
  Do I want a separate save button per offender card, or one to save all changes made on the view?
      Mark edited/unsaved items with asterisk or other indicator
      Warning if not saved
  Filtering / sorting by offender name
  Delete function? (Won't show up on main view but still searchable in archive)
  Upload image function (for screenshots of offending posts/comments before they get deleted
  Check for duplicates before adding new offender
  Field for link to FB profile in case they change their name
  Ability to Edit name field??
