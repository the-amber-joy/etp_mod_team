# Point Tracker

I help moderate a huge group on Facebook. We have some rules. Some people skirt close to the edges of those rules without explicitly breaking them, and they do this over and over again. The Mod Team had been keeping track of these people in a shared Google spreadsheet, and bans repeat offenders based on their history.

This tool was created with the intention of making that task a little easier and prettier.
